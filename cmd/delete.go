	Long: `Deletes multiple S3 objects based on a list provided in a specified file.
Each line in the file should contain the full S3 path for an object to be deleted (e.g., my-bucket/my-object.txt).

Example:
s3magic delete /path/to/objects_to_delete.txt`,
	Args: cobra.ExactArgs(1), // Expect exactly one argument: the file path
	Run: func(cmd *cobra.Command, args []string) {

		// In a real implementation, you would add logic here to:
		// 1. Read and parse the specified file.
		// 2. For each object in the file, interact with the AWS SDK to perform the deletion.
		// 3. Handle errors (e.g., file not found, malformed file, S3 deletion errors).
		// 4. Provide progress and summary feedback.

		// Dummy implementation:
		// Check if file exists as a basic validation
